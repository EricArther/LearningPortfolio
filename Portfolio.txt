-----Hello World-----
Making the console app that outputs "Hello World". Twice.
One of the way to do this is simply use the code

Console.WriteLine("Hello World");

The another way to do this is initialise the named value then output that value.

string output = "Hello World";
Console.WriteLine(output);

In the first line of the code, "Hello World" was assigned to the string value named "output".



-----Variables, Operators and Decisions-----
Understanding operators. +, -, * and / can be used for calculation. Like

int number1 = 3;
int number2 = 5
int number3 = number1 + number2;

in this case, the value "number3" has is 8 (3+5).

To read the user input, this code will be used.

Console.ReadLine();

This code itself or inputs from this code works as string value so if the int value was required from the user

int.Parse();

can be used. This code converts the value in brackets into int.



-----Conditional Statements and Program Flow. Loops.-----
"if" statement can be used for checking a condition like checking what the value user entered or checking if two values are same.

int i = 5;
int ii = 5;
if(i == ii){
  Console.WriteLine("they are same.");
}

it will print out the message "they are same." because condition in brackets are met (i == ii / 5 == 5). In words, it is "if i and ii are same say they are same.". With "else" you can set the action when the if condition weren't met.

int i = 5;
int ii = 4;
if(i == ii){
  Console.WriteLine("they are same.");
}else {
  Console.WriteLine("they are not same");
}

it will print out the message "they are not same." because condition in brackets are not met (i == ii /  5 == 4 but they are not). "else if" can be used to set another condition. If the condition weren't met it'll check next one.

int i = 5;
int ii = 4;
if(i == ii){
  Console.WriteLine("they are same.");
}else if (i > ii){
  Console.WriteLine("i is bigger than ii");
}
