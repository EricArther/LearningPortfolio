-----Hello World-----
Making the console app that outputs "Hello World". Twice.
One of the way to do this is simply use the code

Console.WriteLine("Hello World");

The another way to do this is initialise the named value then output that value.

string output = "Hello World";
Console.WriteLine(output);

In the first line of the code, "Hello World" was assigned to the string value named "output".



-----Variables, Operators and Decisions-----
Understanding operators. +, -, * and / can be used for calculation. Like

int number1 = 3;
int number2 = 5
int number3 = number1 + number2;

in this case, the value "number3" has is 8 (3+5).

To read the user input, this code will be used.

Console.ReadLine();

This code itself or inputs from this code works as string value so if the int value was required from the user

int.Parse();

can be used. This code converts the value in brackets into int.
