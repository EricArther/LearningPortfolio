-----Hello World-----
Making the console app that outputs "Hello World". Twice.
One of the way to do this is simply use the code

Console.WriteLine("Hello World");

The another way to do this is initialise the named value then output that value.

string output = "Hello World";
Console.WriteLine(output);

In the first line of the code, "Hello World" was assigned to the string value named "output".
